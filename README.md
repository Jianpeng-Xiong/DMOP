DMOP: dynamic multi-objective optimization problem
======
ü¶ßIntroduction
-------
Welcome to my GitHub homepage, where my papers and code are available. 
These are DMOPs written by me, which include all the benchmark tests in the experimental section of my published paper, as well as some additional test sets.
If you have any questions about DMO or related fields, please feel free to communicate with me at any time. QQ-emailüíå:1972026766@qq.com. üòá

ü¶äEnvironment
---
The operating environment is based on [Matlab2018b](https://www.mathworks.com/) at least. 
The platform we are using is an improved development based on the existing platform. 
__`Not open to the public`__, therefore this code __`cannot`__ run on your computer, for reference only. üò≠
